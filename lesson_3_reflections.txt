Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    -there might be changes that you don't want to work with at the time.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    -Clone is a copy that if you push changes to will modify the origin repo. Fork creates a new origin repo, branch is a version of a repo. 

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally
    -So you can work offline.
